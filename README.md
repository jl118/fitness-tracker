  ## Installation
  
  *Steps required to install project:*
  
  This app is deployed to Heroku [here](https://safe-ravine-28870.herokuapp.com/). 
  
  This application can also be cloned to a user's machine if they so choose, where they will have to install all necessary packages using `npm i`. MongoDB will also have to be installed on the user's machine for it to work locally. Once everything is installed, run the application with the command `node server.js`. 
  
  ## Usage 
  
  Link to deployed application: [https://safe-ravine-28870.herokuapp.com/](https://safe-ravine-28870.herokuapp.com/)

  Once you click on the link to the application, you will see an option to add a new workout. There you can choose what type of workout it is (cardio or resistance) and depending on what type of workout it is, you can input the name of the exercise, the distance or weight, the duration, and so on. You can input multiple exercises by clicking Add Exercise, or if you are done, you may click Complete. 
  
  Once you choose complete, you will be redirected to the home screen where you will be able to view the last workout you submitted, including the total workout duration, distance covered, weight lifted, sets, and reps. 
  
  The Dashboard tab at the top will bring you to a page showing the user's stats over the last week, showing the total workout duration for each day on the left, and the total weight lifted in pounds on the right.
